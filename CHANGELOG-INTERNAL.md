### Database Security & Performance Fixes (Supabase)
- **SECURITY**: Fixed Row Level Security (RLS) policies:
  - Added RLS policies for `public.sample_table` to allow authenticated user access
  - Fixed mutable `search_path` vulnerabilities in database functions:
    - Updated `public.set_active_variation` function with `SET search_path = public`

    - Updated `public.create_message_variation` function with `SET search_path = public`
    - Updated `public.sync_chat_tags_user_id` function with `SET search_path = public` (including trigger recreation)
  - Optimized RLS policies to prevent auth function re-evaluation:
    - Replaced `auth.uid()` with `(SELECT auth.uid())` in all table policies
    - Applied to tables: profiles, api_keys, chats, chat_messages, folders, tags, chat_tags
- **PERFORMANCE**: Added database indexes for foreign keys:
  - Added index `idx_chat_tags_tag_id` on `public.chat_tags(tag_id)`
  - Added index `idx_chat_tags_user_id` on `public.chat_tags(user_id)`

    - **ChatView.tsx**: Implemented message deduplication filter before rendering to prevent duplicate messages at component level
    - **Index.tsx**: Enhanced variation change handlers with duplicate prevention for both optimistic updates and revert operations
    - **Technical Pattern**: Consistent deduplication using `arr.findIndex(m => m.id === msg.id) === index` across all query cache updates
    - **Root Cause**: Race conditions in concurrent message state updates during rewrite operations causing duplicate message IDs in arrays
    - **Impact**: Eliminates React key warnings and ensures single message rendering throughout the application lifecycle
- **LATEST**: Fixed message ordering and rewrite association issues:
    - **ChatView.tsx**: Enhanced message sorting with detailed comments explaining chronological ordering to prevent AI responses appearing above user input
    - **useRewrite.ts**: Improved user message finding logic with robust filtering and sorting instead of position-based assumptions to fix "Could not find user message" errors
    - **Index.tsx**: Implemented `useMemo` for consistent `sortedMessages` state across all components (ChatView, Header, useRewrite) to prevent state inconsistencies
    - **Root Cause**: Inconsistent message arrays between components and unreliable position-based message association in rewrite logic
    - **Impact**: Ensures proper message chronological order without page reload and enables immediate rewrite functionality without "user message not found" errors
- **LATEST**: Fixed streaming indicator placement and UI jumping:
    - **ChatView.tsx**: Refactored message rendering to group user-assistant pairs, preventing visual jumps during streaming
    - **messageOperationsService.ts**: Modified `addUserMessage` to use optimistic updates, ensuring user messages appear before streaming indicators
    - **UI Enhancement**: User messages now remain fixed in position with streaming indicators appearing directly below
    - **Technical Implementation**: Added message grouping logic that pairs user messages with their corresponding assistant responses, plus optimistic user message rendering
    - **Root Cause**: Sequential message rendering caused user messages to jump when streaming indicators appeared, and async user message creation allowed assistant placeholders to appear first
    - **Impact**: Eliminates distracting UI jumps and provides smooth chat experience with consistent message positioning and proper chronological order

## [Unreleased]
### Latest Changes - 2025-01-26

#### Message Persistence Issues - CRITICAL BUG FIXES
**Problem Solved**: Messages disappearing from chat history due to automatic query invalidation overwriting UI-only state

**Issues Fixed**:
- **Message Disappearing**: Automatic `queryClient.invalidateQueries` calls were refetching messages from database, overwriting UI-only state
- **Error Message Persistence**: Error messages now persist correctly in chat history
- **Interrupted Message Persistence**: Interrupted messages maintain their bubbles regardless of new messages

- Modified streaming fallback logic to prevent onError calls during graceful fallbacks, eliminating flash of error messages during normal operation
- Removed problematic automatic error bubble creation that was causing error messages to disappear and conflict with normal message flow
- Added parent message existence check in `createMessageVariation` to prevent console errors from invalid variation attempts

#### App Loading Fix - CRITICAL BUG FIX
**Problem Solved**: App completely broken and not loading due to undefined `onStop` reference in ChatView component

**Issues Fixed**:
- **Runtime Error**: "Uncaught ReferenceError: onStop is not defined" at line 138 in ChatView.tsx
- **TypeScript Error**: "Cannot find name 'onStop'. Did you mean 'stop'?" preventing compilation
- **App Crash**: Entire application failing to load with "An error has occurred" message

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/ChatView.tsx` - Added missing `onStop` prop to component destructuring

**Technical Details**:
- `onStop` was defined in ChatViewProps interface but not destructured in component parameters
- Added `onStop` to the destructuring assignment to match the interface definition
- This resolves the reference error that was preventing the app from loading

#### Stop Button & Message Variation API Fixes - CRITICAL BUG FIXES

**Solution Implemented**:
- **Automatic Detection**: Added logic to detect incomplete conversations (user messages without assistant responses)
- **Error Bubble Generation**: Automatically creates error bubbles for interrupted messages on page load
- **Dual User Support**: Handles both authenticated users (React Query cache) and guest users (sessionStorage)
- **User-Friendly Messaging**: Clear error message explaining the interruption and suggesting retry

**Files Modified**:
- `src/pages/Index.tsx` - Added useEffect to detect incomplete conversations and generate error bubbles

- **Fixed Provider/Model Display**: Updated rewrite function in `Index.tsx` to properly update message with new variation's provider, model, and usage information
- **Enhanced Variation Navigation**: Confirmed existing prev/next controls in `ChatActionIcons.tsx` are working correctly
- **Enhanced Data Consistency**: Ensured all variation data (content, provider, model, usage) is properly synchronized when switching between variations
- **Fixed Duplicate Outputs**: Modified `getMessages` in `chatService.ts` to filter out variations, preventing duplicate messages on page reload
- **Database Function Verification**: Confirmed `get_message_variations` returns all required fields including provider, model, and usage data
- **Fixed Message Content Display**: Updated `ChatMessage.tsx` to display current variation content instead of original message content
- **Enhanced Tooltip Data**: Updated `ChatActionIcons.tsx` to show current variation's provider, model, and usage data in tooltips
- **Verified Persistence**: Confirmed variation persistence works correctly using database `is_active_variation` field and `setActiveVariation` function

#### Rewrite Variation Controls - UI/UX Fixes
- **Moved Controls Inside Chat Bubble**: Relocated variation navigation controls from external action icons to inside the assistant message bubble on the left side
- **Improved Layout Balance**: Positioned variation controls on the left and info icons on the right within the chat bubble for better visual balance
- **Reduced Control Padding**: Minimized spacing between arrow buttons to make controls more compact and prevent overflow
- **Prevented Container Overflow**: Fixed issue where grouped action icons caused chat bubbles to overflow outside their containers
- **Enhanced Mobile Experience**: Improved layout works better on both desktop and mobile devices
- **Fixed Control Positioning**: Previously moved variation controls to the end of action icons with proper visual separation (border-left)
- **Improved Control Layout**: Enhanced spacing and alignment of prev/next buttons with centered counter display
- **Verified Immediate Visibility**: Confirmed controls appear immediately after rewrite completion without requiring page reload
- **Backend Function Compatibility**: Verified `set_active_variation` function signature matches frontend implementation

#### UI & State Implementation Completed:
1. **Prev/Next Controls**: Navigation controls are implemented and functional in `ChatActionIcons.tsx`
