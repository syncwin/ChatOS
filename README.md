```powershell
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/chatos.git
cd chatos

# Run automated setup script (Windows PowerShell)
.\scripts\dev-setup.ps1

# Or run with options
.\scripts\dev-setup.ps1 -Help  # Show all options
```

The script will:
- ‚úÖ Check prerequisites (Node.js 18+, npm, Git)

## Testing & Quality Assurance

### Guest & Authenticated User Testing

ChatOS supports both **guest users** (session-based) and **authenticated users** (persistent data). Both flows must be thoroughly tested:

#### Guest Mode Testing
- ‚úÖ Session-based API key storage (encrypted)
- ‚úÖ Temporary chat data (cleared on session end)
- ‚úÖ No persistent data storage
- ‚úÖ Security warnings displayed

#### Authenticated Mode Testing
- ‚úÖ User registration and login
- ‚úÖ Persistent API key storage (encrypted)
- ‚úÖ Chat history and data persistence
- ‚úÖ Profile management

### Testing Resources

- üìã **[TESTING_CHECKLIST.md](TESTING_CHECKLIST.md)** - Comprehensive testing checklist covering all features
- üåê **Network Testing**: Use `scripts\get-network-info.ps1` to get URLs for live testing
