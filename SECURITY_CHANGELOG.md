## Phase 1: Dynamic Model Selection Implementation
**Date:** Current Implementation
**Status:** ✅ Completed

### New Files Created:
1. **src/services/modelProviderService.ts**
   - Dynamic model fetching service for OpenAI, Google Gemini, and OpenRouter
   - Caching mechanism (30-minute cache duration)
   - Fallback models when API calls fail
   - Secure API key handling (no client-side exposure)
   - Model metadata display (context length, pricing, descriptions)

2. **src/components/ModelSelector.tsx**
   - Searchable dropdown component for model selection
   - Real-time filtering and search
   - Model metadata display with badges
   - Error handling and fallback UI
   - Loading states and skeleton loading

3. **src/components/ui/skeleton.tsx**
   - Loading skeleton component for better UX

4. **SECURITY_CHANGELOG.md**
   - Internal changelog tracking security implementations

### Files Modified:
1. **src/components/ProviderIconSelector.tsx**
   - Integrated with new ModelSelector component
   - Dynamic model selection per provider
   - API key passing for guest users

2. **src/components/Header.tsx**
   - Updated imports for missing icons
   - Maintained existing functionality

3. **src/services/aiProviderService.ts**
   - Added comments for fallback models
   - Enhanced model support documentation

### Features Implemented:
- ✅ Dynamic model fetching from OpenAI API (`/v1/models`)
- ✅ Dynamic model fetching from Google Gemini API (`/v1beta/models`)
- ✅ Dynamic model fetching from OpenRouter API (`/v1/models`)
- ✅ Searchable model selection interface
- ✅ Model metadata display (context length, pricing, descriptions)
- ✅ Graceful error handling with fallback models
- ✅ 30-minute caching for performance
- ✅ Secure API key handling (no client-side exposure for authenticated users)
- ✅ Loading states and skeleton UI
- ✅ Auto-refresh functionality

### Security Considerations:
- API keys are never exposed in client-side code for authenticated users
- Guest users' API keys are handled securely through existing secure storage
- All API calls include proper error handling
- Model data is cached to reduce API calls and improve performance
- Input validation on search queries

### Next Phases:
- Phase 2: Enhanced input validation and rate limiting
- Phase 3: Advanced security monitoring
- Phase 4: Authentication security hardening
- Phase 5: Comprehensive audit logging

## Implementation Notes:
- All existing functionality has been preserved
- New features are additive and don't break existing workflows
- Error boundaries ensure graceful degradation
- Responsive design maintained across all screen sizes
