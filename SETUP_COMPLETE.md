2. Click "Continue as Guest"
3. Add API keys in Settings (session-based, encrypted)
4. Test chat functionality
5. Verify data clears on session end

### Authenticated User Flow
1. Navigate to http://localhost:8080
2. Sign up or login
3. Add API keys in Settings (persistent, encrypted)
4. Test chat functionality
5. Verify data persists across sessions

## 📋 Testing Checklist

Follow the comprehensive **TESTING_CHECKLIST.md** to ensure:
- ✅ Both guest and authenticated modes work
- ✅ API key management functions correctly
- ✅ All AI providers integrate properly
- ✅ Security measures are in place
- ✅ UI/UX works across devices
- ✅ Performance is acceptable

## 🔑 API Keys Required for Testing

To fully test the application, you'll need API keys from at least one provider:

- **OpenAI**: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
- **Anthropic**: https://console.anthropic.com/
- **Google Gemini**: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
- **Mistral**: https://console.mistral.ai/
- **OpenRouter**: https://openrouter.ai/keys

## 🛡️ Security Notes

### Guest Mode Security
- API keys stored in encrypted sessionStorage
- Data cleared when session ends
- Security warnings displayed to users
- No persistent sensitive data

### Authenticated Mode Security
- API keys encrypted in Supabase database
- Row Level Security (RLS) enforced
- User data isolation maintained
- Secure authentication flow

## 🌍 Sharing for Live Testing

### Local Network Sharing
1. Run `scripts\get-network-info.ps1` to get your IP
2. Share http://[your-ip]:8080 with testers
3. Ensure Windows Firewall allows port 8080

### External Sharing (for remote testing)
```powershell
# Option 1: ngrok (recommended)
npm install -g ngrok
ngrok http 8080

# Option 2: localtunnel
npx localtunnel --port 8080

# Option 3: Cloudflare Tunnel
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:8080
```

## 🔧 Development Scripts

```json
{
  "dev": "Start development server",
  "build": "Build for production",
  "preview": "Preview production build",
  "lint": "Run ESLint"
}
```

## 📊 Current Configuration

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **UI**: Radix UI + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- **Backend**: Supabase (Auth + Database + Edge Functions)
- **State**: Tanstack Query + React Context
- **AI Providers**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Mistral, OpenRouter

### Environment Notes
- Supabase URL and keys are currently hardcoded in:
  - `src/lib/supabase/client.ts`
  - `src/services/aiProviderService.ts`
- Consider moving to environment variables for production
- Development server runs on port 8080 with network access enabled
